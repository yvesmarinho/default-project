  - ✅ CI/CD automation: scaffold-tests.yml active for continuous validation

### Fixed

#### BUG-22 CRITICAL: docs/SESSIONS/ Old Folder Created During Upgrade (May 2026)
- **Problem**: scaffold upgrade was creating `docs/SESSIONS/<created_at>/` during upgrade despite migration to `.session-docs/`
- **Root Cause**: 3 locations had legacy code referencing `docs/SESSIONS`:
  - scripts/lib/project.py line 1831 (DIRS_TO_CREATE)
  - scripts/lib/project.py line 2281 (setup_project_docs())
  - scripts/lib/flows/dry_run.py line 25 (manifest path)
- **Fix**: Changed all references from `"docs/SESSIONS"` to `".session-docs"` (3 files modified)
- **Validation**: test_scaffold_upgrade_no_old_sessions_folder now passing
- **Commit**: `1b2bb50`

#### BUG-16: .copilot-rules Consolidation with Symlinks (May 2026)
- **Problem**: detect_copilot_rules_files() counted symlinks as duplicate files
- **Scenario**: 1 real file (.copilot-rules-<project>.md) + 1 symlink (.copilot-rules.md → .copilot-shared/)
- **Root Cause**: scripts/lib/copilot_rules_consolidate.py didn't filter symlinks and missed `.copilot-rules-*.md` pattern
- **Fix**: Added symlink filter `[f for f in matches if not f.is_symlink()]` and pattern `.copilot-rules-*.md`
- **Validation**: test_scaffold_upgrade_merge_strategy now passing
- **Commit**: `8ff4199`

#### BUG-18: objetivo.yaml Project Info Validation (May 2026)
- **Problem**: validate_bug18_objetivo() had hardcoded project name check `project_name == "test-workspace-fix"`
- **Type**: Bug in validation, not in scaffold (objetivo.yaml was correct)
- **Fix**: Changed to generic validation: `bool(project_name) and project_name != "CHANGE_ME"`
- **Impact**: Tests now accept any valid project name, not just hardcoded value
- **Validation**: test_scaffold_upgrade_all_validations and test_scaffold_upgrade_idempotent now passing (51/51)
- **Commit**: `5df0c16`

#### Scaffold Upgrade --ci Flag Fix (May 2026)
- **Problem**: _validate_and_fix_paths() ignored --ci flag causing EOFError (Prompt.ask() with no stdin)
- **Fix**: Added ci_mode parameter to _validate_and_fix_paths() in scripts/lib/flows/upgrade.py
- **Impact**: All upgrade tests now running successfully in non-interactive mode
- **Related**: Part of test automation infrastructure (commit `39a3e66`)

#### BUG-05: Interactive Layer 2 Profile Selection (Apr 2026)
- **Phase 1 (Core)**: Interactive mode now shows Layer 2 profiles (python-fastapi, typescript-next, etc.):
  - Added `_get_compatible_layer2_profiles()` in `scripts/lib/ui.py`:
    - Reads profile-descriptors/*.yaml dynamically
    - Filters by domain + language compatibility
    - Supports both old (requires) and new (meta) descriptor formats
    - Handles language aliases (hcl→terraform, yaml→kubernetes)
    - Domain inference from tags (web/api→programming, iac/cloud→infrastructure, data/etl→analysis)
  - Added `_select_layer2_profile()` in `scripts/lib/ui.py`:
    - New question [9] in interactive wizard
    - Shows only compatible profiles for selected domain + language
    - Numbered menu with profile descriptions
    - Default option: "No, just base structure"
  - Modified `_collect_extra_profiles()` to integrate Layer 2 selection:
    - Layer 1 profiles (devops-programming, devops-infrastructure, devops-analysis) remain separate (question [8])
    - Layer 2 profiles shown dynamically based on domain + language (question [9])
    - Returns combined list: Layer 1 extras + selected Layer 2 profile
  - Resolves: "novice users cannot select python-fastapi in interactive mode" (original bug report)

- **Phase 2 (Enhancement)**: Added `--with-code-profile` flag to `new` command:
  - New argument in `scaffold.py`: `--with-code-profile PROFILE`
  - One-step project creation with code profile: `scaffold.py new --ci --name my-api --domain programming --language python --with-code-profile python-fastapi`
  - Equivalent to: `scaffold.py new ... && cd project && scaffold.py compose python-fastapi`
  - Integration in `scripts/lib/flows/new_project.py`:
    - Executes `flow_compose_profiles()` after project creation if flag provided
    - Always non-interactive when using --with-code-profile
    - Complete error handling with rollback on compose failure
  - Benefits:
    - ✅ Single command workflow
    - ✅ Validates domain + language compatibility
    - ✅ Proper state persistence in .scaffold-state.yaml
    - ✅ Used automatically by interactive mode (question [9])

- **Phase 3 (Documentation)**:
  - Updated `docs/guides/NEW_PROJECT_COMMAND.md`:
    - New section: "Modo Interativo com Layer 2" explaining question [9]
    - Updated examples to use `--with-code-profile` (recommended over 2-step workflow)
    - Added comparison: `--with-code-profile` vs `compose` separate command
    - Documented workflow: 1 command vs 2 steps with pros/cons
  - Updated help text in `scaffold.py`:
    - Clear usage example for `--with-code-profile`
    - Explains equivalence to separate compose command
  - Resolves: UX confusion for novice users (no documentation for Layer 2 profiles)

Impact:
- ✅ Novice users can now discover and select Layer 2 profiles interactively
- ✅ CLI power users get single-command workflow with `--with-code-profile`
- ✅ Backward compatible: 2-step workflow (new → compose) still works
- ✅ Dynamic profile discovery: new profiles automatically appear in wizard
- ✅ Smart filtering: only shows profiles compatible with selected domain + language

**Status**: Phases 1-3 complete (9h work), Phase 4 (Tests) in progress
**Priority**: P1 — UX blocker for novice users
**Related**: IMP-65 (template synchronization), BUG-02/BUG-03 (fixed)

### Changed

#### Session Manager Agent v1.2.0 (Mar 2026)
- **Session End Workflow (D-17)**: `git push` agora é obrigatório no encerramento de sessão
  - Modificado: `.github/agents/session-manager.agent.md` — passo 7 "Git Repository Update"
  - Comportamento anterior: push era opcional ("Optionally push if requested")
  - Comportamento novo: push é mandatório com retry automático em caso de falha
  - Se push falhar: executa `git pull --rebase` automaticamente e tenta novamente
  - Session Closure Report atualizado: "Git: [N] commits created and pushed"
  - Alinhamento com `.github/prompts/session-end.prompt.md` que já documentava push obrigatório
  - Impacto: garante que repositório remoto esteja sempre sincronizado ao final da sessão
  - Benefício: elimina risco de perda de trabalho; melhora rastreabilidade; facilita colaboração

## [9.9.9] — 2026-03-14

### Added

#### Validação de Profile Descriptors (IMP-32)
- `scripts/lib/validate.py` — módulo de validação de profile-descriptors:
  - `validate_descriptors(dir) → ValidationReport` — valida todos os `.yaml` em `profile-descriptors/`
  - 6 regras por descriptor: `name`, `description`, `version` (semver X.Y.Z), `last_tested`, `layer`, sintaxe YAML
  - Validação cruzada: nomes duplicados + `combines_with`/`excludes_with` com perfis inexistentes (warning)
  - Compatível com schema antigo (`VERSION`/`LAST_TESTED_DATE`) e novo (`version`/`last_tested`)
  - `combines_with` aceita lista de strings e lista de objetos `{name, notes}`
  - Exit code 0 se `valid=True` (erros=0; avisos são permitidos); exit code 1 se há erros
- `scripts/scaffold.py --validate` — flag CLI de validação; `--validate --json` para CI/automação
- `tests/test_smoke_imp32.py` — 42 testes (410 total)

#### CI/CD do Template (IMP-31)
- `.github/workflows/ci-template.yml` — workflow GitHub Actions completo com 3 jobs:
  - **test** — matrix Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 rodando `pytest tests/ --tb=short -q`
  - **cli-smoke** — `--list-profiles --json`, `--dry-run`, `--publish --json` contra código real
  - **lint** — `py_compile` em todos `scripts/lib/*.py` + `yaml.safe_load` em todos `profile-descriptors/*.yaml`
- Disparo em `pull_request` e `push` com filtro de paths (`scripts/**`, `tests/**`, `profile-descriptors/**`)
- `concurrency` com `cancel-in-progress: true` para PRs
- `tests/test_smoke_imp31.py` — 26 testes (368 total)

#### Release Publishing (IMP-30)
- `scripts/lib/publish.py` — módulo de publicação de release:
  - `publish_template(output_dir, project_root)` — gera `enterprise-template-v{version}-{YYYYMMDD}.tar.gz`
  - `_collect_files(project_root)` — coleta arquivos por padrões de inclusão, excluindo `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `.git`, `.secrets`, `dist`, `*.pyc`
  - Manifesto JSON (`release-manifest-v{version}-{YYYYMMDD}.json`) com `version`, `file_count`, `size_bytes`, `files`
  - Idempotente por data: chamadas múltiplas no mesmo dia sobrescrevem o tarball anterior
- `scripts/scaffold.py --publish` — flag CLI para gerar release tarball
- `scripts/scaffold.py --output-dir PATH` — diretório de saída configurável (default: `dist/`)
- `tests/test_smoke_imp30.py` — 35 testes (342 total)

#### Documentação por Perfil (IMP-29)
- `scripts/lib/templates.py` — `generate_profile_guide()` — gera `docs/PROFILE-GUIDE-{combo}.md` no projeto destino:
  - Tabela de perfis ativos com camada e descrição
  - Inventário de arquivos gerados por perfil (de `generates.files` / `templates`)
  - Requisitos de segurança consolidados (de `security.enforces`)
  - Quick Start com pré-requisitos e pré-requisitos agregados
  - Referências por stack (baseadas nas `tags` dos perfis)
  - Idempotente — não sobrescreve se já existe
- `_compute_combo_slug()` — slug derivado dos perfis layer2+ (exclui core e transversais)
- `_layer_order_int()` / `_layer_display_name()` — helpers de mapeamento de camada
- `scripts/scaffold.py` — integração: guia gerado após composição e após `--upgrade`
- `tests/test_smoke_imp29.py` — 33 testes (307 total)
